# Added Origins Reborn
Added Origins R is the new "real" version of Added Origins. As of 4.0.0, it has been converted into a real mod instead of a Global Datapack (basically a very light mod).
4.0.0+ introduces new powers, balancing changes, and origin reworks. 

I completely understand that many people actually requested this mod to be updated many years ago, and to be honest, I never got around to it. There originally was a version 4.0.0 that I was planning to release, but I quit modding right before that happened. The original 4.0.0 file is long gone, and I don't even remember what it had.

## All Base Changes (4.0.0 onwards)
* The Rat origin has been removed
* All "Upgraded" origins have been removed
* The Zythl/Xestrial are now under the same Origin and are instead different subtypes of the "Xtraterestrial Origin."
* All Origins have been reworked from the ground up.
* The Mod now uses actual custom powers instead of workarounds that don't work half the time
* This mod will no longer support Forge (at least for the first few versions)
